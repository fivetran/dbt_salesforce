## What does this dbt package do?
- Produces modeled tables that leverage Salesforce data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/salesforce) in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/salesforce#schema) and builds off the output of our [Salesforce source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_salesforce_source).
- This package also provides you with the option to leverage the history mode to gather historical records of your essential tables.

- This package enables users to:
  - Understand the performance of your opportunities
  - Drill into how the members of your sales team are performing
  - Have a daily summary of sales activities
  - Leverage an enhanced contact list
  - View more details about opportunity line items
  - Gather daily historical records of your accounts, contacts and opportunities

<!--section="salesforce_transformation_model"-->
This package also generates a comprehensive data dictionary of your source and modeled Salesforce data via the [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_salesforce/)
You can also refer to the table below for a detailed view of all tables materialized by default within this package.

|**Table**|**Description**|**Available in Quickstart?**

| [salesforce__account_daily_history](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_salesforce/#!/model/model.salesforce.salesforce__account_daily_history) | Each record is a daily record in an account, starting with its first active date and updating up toward either the current date (if still active) or its last active date. | No
| [salesforce__contact_daily_history](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_salesforce/#!/model/model.salesforce.salesforce__contact_daily_history) |  Each record is a daily record in an contact, starting with its first active date and updating up toward either the current date (if still active) or its last active date. | No
| [salesforce__opportunity_daily_history](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_salesforce/#!/model/model.salesforce.salesforce__opportunity_daily_history) | Each record is a daily record in an opportunity, starting with its first active date and updating up toward either the current date (if still active) or its last active date. | No

**Note**: For Quickstart Data Model users only, in addition to the above output models that are Quickstart compatible, you will also receive models in your transformation list which replicate **all** of your Salesforce objects with the inclusion of the relevant formula fields in the generated output models.
### Materialized Models
Each Quickstart transformation job run materializes 23 models if all components of this data model are enabled. This count includes all staging, intermediate, and final models materialized as `view`, `table`, or `incremental`.
<!--section-end-->

## How do I use the dbt package?
### Step 1: Pre-Requisites
To use this dbt package, you must have the following:
- At least one  Fivetran Salesforce connection syncing data into your destination.
- A BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, PostgreSQL, or Databricks destination.

#### Databricks Dispatch Configuration
If you are using a Databricks destination with this package you will need to add the below (or a variation of the below) dispatch configuration within your `dbt_project.yml`. This is required in order for the package to accurately search for macros within the `dbt-labs/spark_utils` then the `dbt-labs/dbt_utils` packages respectively.
```yml
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt_utils
    search_order: ['spark_utils', 'dbt_utils']
```

#### Database Incremental Strategies
The history end models in this package are materialized incrementally. We have chosen `insert_overwrite` as the default strategy for **BigQuery** and **Databricks** databases, as it is only available for these dbt adapters. For **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, and **Postgres** databases, we have chosen `delete+insert` as the default strategy.

`insert_overwrite` is our preferred incremental strategy because it will be able to properly handle updates to records that exist outside the immediate incremental window. That is, because it leverages partitions, `insert_overwrite` will appropriately update existing rows that have been changed upstream instead of inserting duplicates of them--all without requiring a full table scan.

`delete+insert` is our second-choice as it resembles `insert_overwrite` but lacks partitions. This strategy works most of the time and appropriately handles incremental loads that do not contain changes to past records. However, if a past record has been updated and is outside of the incremental window, `delete+insert` will insert a duplicate record.
> Because of this, we highly recommend that **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, and **Postgres** users periodically run a `--full-refresh` to ensure a high level of data quality and remove any possible duplicates.

### Step 2: Installing the Package
Include the following salesforce package version in your `packages.yml`
> Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.
```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/salesforce 
    version: [">=1.2.0", "<1.3.0"] # we recommend using ranges to capture non-breaking changes automatically
```

Do NOT include the `salesforce_source` package in this file. The transformation package itself has a dependency on it and will install the source package as well.

### Step 3: Configure Your Variables
#### Database and Schema Variables
By default, this package will run using your target database and the `salesforce` schema. If this is not where your Salesforce data is, add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
    salesforce_database: your_database_name    
    salesforce_schema: your_schema_name
```

#### Disabling Models
Your Salesforce connection may not sync every table that this package expects. If your syncs exclude certain tables, it is because you either don't use that functionality in Salesforce or actively excluded some tables from your syncs.

To disable the corresponding functionality in this package, you must add the corresponding variable(s) to your `dbt_project.yml`, which are listed below. By default, that is if none of these variables are added, all variables are assumed to be true. Add variables only for the tables you would like to disable:

```yml
vars:
  salesforce__user_role_enabled: false # Disable if you do not have the user_role table
  salesforce__lead_enabled: false # Disable if you do not have the lead table
  salesforce__event_enabled: false # Disable if you do not have the event table
  salesforce__task_enabled: false # Disable if you do not have the task table
  salesforce__opportunity_line_item_enabled: false # Disable if you do not have the opportunity_line_item table
  salesforce__order_enabled: false # Disable if you do not have the order table
  salesforce__product_2_enabled: false # Disable if you do not have the product_2 table
```
The corresponding metrics from the disabled tables will not populate in the downstream models.

#### Working without an `OPPORTUNITY` Table
If you do not have the `OPPORTUNITY` table, there is no variable to turn off opportunity-related transformations, as this table is largely the backbone of the Salesforce package.

However, you may still find value in this package without opportunity data, specifically in the `salesforce__contact_enhanced`, `salesforce__daily_activity`, `salesforce__account_daily_history` and `salesforce__contact_daily_history` (if using History Mode) end models.

For this use case, to ensure the package runs successfully, we recommend leveraging this [Fivetran Feature](https://fivetran.com/docs/using-fivetran/features#syncingemptytablesandcolumns) to create an empty `opportunity` table. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to your Salesforce connection in the "Connectors" tab within the Fivetran UI.
2. Click on the "Schema" tab.
3. Scroll down to `Opportunity` and click on its checkbox to add it into your schema.
4. Click "Save Changes" in the upper righthand corner of the screen.
5. Either click "Resync" for the `Opportunity` table specifically or wait for your next connection-level sync.

> Note that all other end models (`salesforce__opportunity_enhanced`, `salesforce__opportunity_line_item_enhanced`, `salesforce__manager_performance`, `salesforce__owner_performance`, `salesforce__sales_snapshot`, and `salesforce__opportunity_daily_history`) will still materialize after a blanket `dbt run` but will be largely empty/null.

### (Optional) Step 4: Utilizing Salesforce History Mode records
If you have Salesforce [History Mode](https://fivetran.com/docs/using-fivetran/features#historymode) enabled for your connection, we now include support for the `account`, `contact`, and `opportunity` tables directly. These staging models from our `dbt_salesforce_source` package flow into our daily history models. This will allow you access to your historical data for these tables while taking advantage of incremental loads to help with compute.

#### IMPORTANT: How To Update Your History Models
To ensure maximum value for these history mode models and avoid messy historical data that could come with picking and choosing which fields you bring in, **all fields in your Salesforce history mode connection are being synced into your end staging models**. That means all custom fields you picked to sync are being brought in to the final models. [See our DECISIONLOG for more details on why we are bringing in all fields](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_salesforce_source/blob/main/DECISIONLOG.md).

To update the history mode models, you must follow these steps:
1) Go to your Fivetran Salesforce History Mode connection page.
2) Update the fields that you are bringing into the model.
3) Run a `dbt run --full-refresh` on the specific staging models you've updated to bring in these fields and all the historical data available with these fields.

We are aware that bringing in additional fields will be very process-heavy, so we do emphasize caution in making changes to your history mode connection. It would be best to batch as many field changes as possible before executing a `--full-refresh` to save on processing.

#### Configuring Your Salesforce History Mode Database and Schema Variables
Customers with a Salesforce connection generally fall into one of two categories when taking advantage of History mode. They either have one connection that is syncing non-historical records and a separate connection that syncs historical records, **or** they have one connection that is syncing historical records. We have designed this feature to support both scenarios.

##### Option 1: Two connections, one with non-historical data and another with historical data
If you are gathering data from both standard Salesforce as well as Salesforce History Mode, and your target database and schema differ as well, you will need to add an additional configuration for the history schema and database to your `dbt_project.yml`.

```yml
vars:
    salesforce_database: your_database_name # salesforce by default
    salesforce_schema: your_schema_name

    salesforce_history_database: your_history_database_name # salesforce_history by default
    salesforce_history_schema: your_history_schema_name
```

##### Option 2: One connection being used to sync historical data
Perhaps you may only want to use the Salesforce History Mode to bring in your data. Because the Salesforce schema is pointing to the default `salesforce` schema and database, you will want to add the following variable into your `dbt_project.yml` to point it to the `salesforce_history` equivalents.

```yml
vars:
    salesforce_database: your_history_database_name # salesforce by default
    salesforce_schema: your_history_schema_name

    salesforce_history_database: your_history_database_name # salesforce_history by default
    salesforce_history_schema: your_history_schema_name
```

**IMPORTANT**: If you utilize Option 2, you must sync the equivalent enabled tables and fields in your history mode connection that are being brought into your end reports. Examine your data lineage and the model fields within the `salesforce` folder to see which tables and fields you are using and need to bring in and sync in the history mode connection.

#### Enabling Salesforce History Mode Models
The History Mode models can get quite expansive since it will take in **ALL** historical records, so we've disabled them by default. You can enable the history models you'd like to utilize by adding the below variable configurations within your `dbt_project.yml` file for the equivalent models.

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
vars:
  salesforce__account_history_enabled: true  # False by default. Only use if you have history mode enabled and wish to view the full historical record of all your synced account fields, particularly in the daily account history model.
  salesforce__contact_history_enabled: true  # False by default. Only use if you have history mode enabled and wish to view the full historical record of all your synced contact fields, particularly in the daily contact history model.
  salesforce__opportunity_history_enabled: true  # False by default. Only use if you have history mode enabled and wish to view the full historical record of all your synced opportunity fields, particularly in the daily opportunity history model.
```

#### Filter your Salesforce History Mode models with field variable conditionals
By default, these models are set to bring in all your data from Salesforce History, but you may be interested in bringing in only a smaller sample of historical records, given the relative size of the Salesforce History source tables. By default, the package will use `2020-01-01` as the minimum date for the historical end models. This date was chosen to ensure there was a limit to the amount of historical data processed on first run. This default may be overwritten to your liking by leveraging the below variables.

We have set up where conditions in our staging models to allow you to bring in only the data you need to run in. You can set a global history filter that would apply to all of our staging history models in your `dbt_project.yml`:


```yml 
vars:
    global_history_start_date: 'YYYY-MM-DD' # The first `_fivetran_start` date you'd like to filter data on in all your history models.
```

If you'd like to apply model-specific conditionals, configure the below variables in your `dbt_project.yml`:

```yml 
vars:
    account_history_start_date: 'YYYY-MM-DD' # The first date in account history you wish to pull records from, filtering on `_fivetran_start`.
    contact_history_start_date: 'YYYY-MM-DD' # The first date in contact history you wish to pull records from, filtering on `_fivetran_start`.
    opportunity_history_start_date: 'YYYY-MM-DD' # The first date in opportunity history you wish to pull records from, filtering on `_fivetran_start`.
```

### (Optional) Step 5: Additional Configurations
#### Change the Source Table References
Source tables are referenced using default names. If an individual source table has a different name than expected, provide the name of the table as it appears in your warehouse to the respective variable:
> IMPORTANT: See the package's source [`dbt_project.yml`](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_salesforce_source/blob/main/dbt_project.yml) variable declarations to see the expected names.

```yml
vars:
    <package_name>_<default_source_table_name>_identifier: your_table_name
``` 

#### Change the Build Schema
By default, this package builds the GitHub staging models within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_stg_salesforce`) in your target database. If this is not where you would like your GitHub staging data to be written to, add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
models:
    salesforce_source:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```
#### Adding Passthrough Columns
This package allows users to add additional columns to the `salesforce__opportunity_enhanced`, `salesforce__opportunity_line_item_enhanced`,`salesforce__contact_enhanced`, and any of the `daily_history` models if you have Salesforce history mode enabled. You can do this by using the below variables in your `dbt_project.yml` file. These variables allow these additional columns to be aliased (`alias`) and casted (`transform_sql`) if desired, but not required. Datatype casting is configured via a sql snippet within the `transform_sql` key. You may add the desired sql while omitting the `as field_name` at the end and your custom pass-though fields will be casted accordingly. Use the below format for declaring the respective pass-through variables.

For the `salesforce__opportunity_enhanced` model, it joins in the `user` model two times, since an opportunity has both an owner and manager. The first time the `user` model is joined is to add information about an opportunity owner. The second time is to add information about an opportunity manager. Therefore to avoid ambiguous columns from joining in the same model twice, custom fields passed through from the user table will be suffixed based on whether it belongs to a user who is an `_owner` or a `_manager`.

Additionally, you may add additional columns to the staging models. For example, for passing columns to `stg_salesforce__product_2` you would need to configure `salesforce__product_2_pass_through_columns`.

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
vars:
  salesforce__account_pass_through_columns: 
    - name: "salesforce__account_field"
      alias: "renamed_field"
      transform_sql: "cast(renamed_field as string)"
  salesforce__contact_pass_through_columns: 
    - name: "salesforce__contact_field"
      alias: "contact_field_x"
  salesforce__event_pass_through_columns: 
    - name: "salesforce__event_field"
      transform_sql: "cast(salesforce__event_field as int64)"
  salesforce__lead_pass_through_columns: 
    - name: "salesforce__lead_field"
  salesforce__opportunity_pass_through_columns: 
    - name: "salesforce__opportunity_field"
      alias: "opportunity_field_x"
  salesforce__opportunity_line_item_pass_through_columns: 
    - name: "salesforce__opportunity_line_item_field"
      alias: "opportunity_line_item_field_x"
    - name: "field_name_2"
  salesforce__order_pass_through_columns: 
    - name: "salesforce__order_field"
      alias: "order_field_x"
    - name: "another_field"
      alias: "field_abc"
  salesforce__product_2_pass_through_columns: 
    - name: "salesforce__product_2_field"
      alias: "product_2_field_x"
  salesforce__task_pass_through_columns: 
    - name: "salesforce__task_field"
      alias: "task_field_x"
  salesforce__user_role_pass_through_columns: 
    - name: "salesforce__user_role_field"
      alias: "user_role_field_x"
  salesforce__user_pass_through_columns: 
    - name: "salesforce__user_field"
```

### (Optional) Step 6: Adding Formula Fields as Pass Through Columns
#### Adding Formula Fields as Pass Through Columns
The source tables Fivetran syncs do not include formula fields. If your company uses them, you can generate them by referring to the [Salesforce Formula Utils](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_salesforce_formula_utils) package. To pass through the fields, add the [latest version of the package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_salesforce_formula_utils#installing-the-macro-package). We recommend confirming your formula field models successfully populate before integrating with the Salesforce package.

Include the following within your `dbt_project.yml` file:
```yml
# Using the opportunity source table as example, update the opportunity variable to reference your newly created model that contains the formula fields:
  salesforce_account_identifier: "'my_new_opportunity_formula_table'"

# In addition, add the desired field names as pass through columns
  salesforce__opportunity_pass_through_columns:
    - name: "salesforce__opportunity_field"
      alias: "opportunity_field_x"
```

### (Optional) Step 7: Orchestrate your models with Fivetran Transformations for dbt Coreâ„¢
Fivetran offers the ability for you to orchestrate your dbt project through the [Fivetran Transformations for dbt Coreâ„¢](https://fivetran.com/docs/transformations/dbt) product. Refer to the linked docs for more information on how to setup your project for orchestration through Fivetran.
